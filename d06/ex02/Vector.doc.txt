<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles space 3D Vectors.
More than three coordinates, it has got an homogenous parameter (always=0)

An instance is contructed from two Vertex orig and dest.
It represents then the vector between thos two points.
new Vector( array( 'dest' => #instanceOfVertex, 'orig' => #instanceOfVertex );
Ff the vertex 'orig' is not precised, it will then be (0,0,0) as default.

All Attributes are private, you may want to use getters.
When a Vector is created, you wont be able to change its values after.
aka-> no setters;

The following method are providing for this Class:

- magnitude() : give the norme of the instanced Vector.

- normalize() : give the normalized Vector correspondig (a fresh copy
if the instance was already normalized)

- add( Vector $v ) : give the result of the addition between
the current instance and $.

- sub( Vector $v ) : give the result of the substraction between
the current instance and $.

- opposite() : return the opposite Vector;

- scalarProduct( $k ) : return the product of the constant $k
and the current instance;

- dotProduct( Vector $v ) : return the scalar product of the current
instance and $v.

- cos( Vector $v ) : return the cosinus between the current instance and $v

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : return the cross product
(right handed set) of the current instance and $v
